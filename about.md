# Who am I?
I am Ahmad Ayaz Amin, though I go by Ayaz. I am a first year computer science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. I do various different projects, ranging from video games and vehicle simulators, to machine learning research (with a heavy emphasis on generative modelling). In this blog you can find writeups about different projects and research that I do.
