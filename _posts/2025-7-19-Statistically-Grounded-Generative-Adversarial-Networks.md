title: Statistically Grounded Generative Adversarial Networks
---

Although I've worked with machine learning for over six years—mostly in variational inference, energy-based models, and normalizing flows — I had never implemented a generative adversarial network (or GAN) from scratch until recently. My antagonism towards GANs stemmed from (possibly outdated) misunderstandings — many of which were perpetuated due to a variety of different interpretations from many different papers, blogposts and articles.

However, curiosity piqued my interest after reading up on [implicit density ratio estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03483), [noise contrastive estimation](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a.html) and their uses in [implicit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09804) [variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04722) among other things; so I knew I had to give GANs a shot.

 Rather than following existing tutorials, I approached the task the way I’ve always understood generative modeling: through the lens of divergence minimization and density ratio estimation.

## The Perspective: Ratio Estimation Meets Divergence Minimization

This framing comes directly from two pivotal papers:

- [*Improved Generator Objectives for GANs*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02780) — Poole et al., 2016  
- [*f-GAN: Training Generative Neural Samplers using Variational Divergence Minimization*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00709) — Nowozin, Cseke, and Tomioka, 2016

They recast GAN training as a **two-step process**:

1. **Train the discriminator** to estimate the **log-density ratio** between data and generator distributions.
2. **Train the generator** to minimize a divergence to the data distribution, using the discriminator’s output.

Instead of treating GANs as black-box adversarial games, this gives us a principled statistical foundation that feels at home in the world of variational methods and EBMs.

## The Discriminator: Log-Ratio Estimation via BCE

In my implementation, the discriminator outputs *raw logits* (no sigmoid activation function), and is trained using binary cross-entropy with logits:

```python
disc_real_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(disc(x_real), disc_real, reduction='mean')
disc_fake_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(disc(x_fake.detach()), disc_fake, reduction='mean')
disc_loss = disc_real_loss + disc_fake_loss
```

This is not just a convenient trick — it's essential. Under this loss, the discriminator $$D_\phi(x)$$ approximates:

$$D_\phi(x) \approx \ln \left( \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_g(x)} \right)$$

That is, the log-density ratio between real and generated data. The density ratio appears in the optimal discriminator in standard GAN theory, and is a key ingredient in many f-divergences. Estimating it directly enables flexible generator objectives rooted in statistical inference. This subtle detail — using logits directly — turns the discriminator from a classifier into a density ratio estimator, making it a meaningful statistical object.

## The Generator: Divergence Minimization with Control

Once the discriminator estimates the log-ratio, the generator can minimize a divergence of your choice — still using samples from the generator itself.

### Reverse KL
This is the most straightforward loss, which can be implemented as:
```python
log_ratio = disc(x_fake).squeeze()
gen_loss = -log_ratio.mean()
```
This corresponds to minimizing the reverse KL divergence $$D_{KL}(p_g(x)||p_{data}(x)) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{p_g(x)}[\ln \left( \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x)} \right)]$$

This objective is mode-seeking, which is a property that often leads to sharp samples. But in practice, it doesn't necessarily suffer from mode collapse due to the entropy regularization term in the objective, which allows the generator to generate sufficiently diverse samples.

### Forward KL via Rényi $$\alpha$$-Divergence
To train using forward KL — which is mode-covering — I approximated it using the Rényi $$\alpha$$-divergence, which allows expectations to remain under the generator distribution:

$$
D_\alpha(p_g(x) || p_{data}(x)) = \frac{1}{(\alpha - 1)} \ln \left( \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{p_g(x)}\left[\left( \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_g(x)} \right)^\alpha\right] \right)
$$

Letting $$\alpha → 1$$ recovers the forward KL. In code, this becomes:

```python
alpha = 0.999 # abritrarily close to 1
gen_loss = (1 / (alpha - 1)) * (
    torch.logsumexp(alpha * log_ratio, dim=0) - math.log(batch_size)
)
```

The above implementation is a numerically stable equivalent of the expectation, letting us minimize a good enough estimate of the forward KL using samples from the generator. The forward KL is particularly interesting since it is equivalent to maxmium likleihood, which is the objective for density estimators like variational autoencoders. Thus, a GAN trained with forward KL can also be thought of maximizing likleihood of data.

## Results and Reflections
Here is the evolution of generator samples over the course of 100 iterations. The models were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

Both losses — reverse KL and forward KL (via Rényi) — gave me:
- Stable training
- Sharp and diverse samples
- No noticeable mode collapse (even under reverse KL)

This matched my theoretical expectation (and also the results in Poole et al. 2016): the presence of entropy (even implicit via stochastic generation) plays a major role in preserving sample diversity, regardless of the divergence direction.

What stood out most was the clarity and stability this perspective gave me. I wasn't playing with any heuristics, but optimizing well-defined divergences with known statistical meaning.

## Final Thoughts
This first GAN project was deeply satisfying — not because it broke new ground technically, but because it was grounded in the principles I care about: inference, optimization, and expressive modeling.

Key takeaways:
- GANs can be trained using statistically meaningful divergences, not just heuristic losses.
- The discriminator should be interpreted as a density ratio estimator, not just a classifier.
- Approximating forward KL with Rényi divergence lets you retain a generator-side expectation.
- Reverse KL — when paired with a sufficiently stochastic generator — can be stable and performant.

Importantly, by reframing GAN training through this statistical lens, not only can I reason about this class of models with clarity, but the implementation is actually a lot simpler and (at least in my experiments) more stable. GANs, when framed this way, feel less like unstable black-box tools and more like variational inference algorithms in disguise.

## Extra notes
[Wasserstein GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) (Arjovsky, Chintala and Bottou, 2016) have very little in common with 'vanilla' GANs; unlike the min-max optimization scheme that minimizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence, WGANs minimize the Wasserstein distance, which results in a scheme that resembles [variational energy based modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04230) (Grathwohl et al. 2021), where the generator is matched to the discriminator / energy function to generate approximate samples from the latter; then, the discriminator / energy model penalizes those approximate samples in the standard contrastive divergence training scheme. The generator objective for the variational EBM is the reverse KL divergence, which notably imposes entropy regularization to prevent mode collapse (and results in a good density model). In WGANs, there is no such entropy regularization, which could suggest why there's a whole host of other issues pertaining WGAN training.
