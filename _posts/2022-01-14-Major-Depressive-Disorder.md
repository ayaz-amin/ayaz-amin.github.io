# Introduction

Major Depressive Disorder, colloquially known as depression, is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects one’s feelings, thoughts and actions. Depression can cause feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, and can lead to a variety of physical and emotional problems and decrease the ability to function in day-to-day life. 
Symptoms of depression can include: feeling sad or depressed; losing interest in activities once enjoyed; changes in appetite; sleep problems; fatigue; feeling worthless or guilty; difficulty in thinking and concentrating; and thoughts of death or suicide. Depression is different from sadness and grief, despite being difficult emotions to experience. It is normal for one to feel short-term sadness following the loss of a loved one or job. In sadness, self-esteem is usually retained; in depression, feelings of worthlessness is common. In depression, it is also common to fantasize death and suicide.
Depression is common worldwide, with an estimated 3.8% of people affected, or approximately 280 million people. Among these, 5.0% of adults and 5.7% of adults over 60 years suffer from depression. Differences in culture can have a significant impact on the prevalence of depression. For instance, 20% of Americans will experience major depressive disorder sometime in their lives, while for Chinese, only 2%. Those who suffer from depression are at 25 times greater risk for suicide than the general population. Depression is present in at least 50% of all suicides, with 50-80% of adults who die by suicide being shown to suffer from major depression.

# What causes depression

When learning about depression, it is often summarized as a disease that results from a chemical imbalance, although research suggests otherwise. The information gathered by Harvard Health Education suggests that depression doesn’t stem from having excess or not enough of certain brain chemicals but instead there are many different factors. These factors can be faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, and several other forces that contribute to the diagnosis of depression. To avoid misunderstanding, it is important to know that chemicals are involved in these processes, but rather than it being an excess of one chemical and a lack of another chemical, it is the influence of many different chemicals involved; working together from the inside and outside of nerve cells. There are many millions of chemical reactions that occur which make up the system which is responsible for mood, perception, and the experience of life. 
Depression is strongly linked to one’s physical health; it is proven to be hereditary, affecting half of those who have it. Depression is more common among first-degree relatives – especially an identical twin – of those with depression. Neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine may be involved in depression. Women are more likely to experience depression than men, possibly due to changes in hormone levels. Changes in hormone levels can cause mood changes before menstruation, during pregnancy and after childbirth.

# Treatment

Treatment for depression is dependent on the severity and type of depression. For mild depression, frequent doctor visits and psychotherapy are given, while moderate to severe depression is treated with drugs, psychotherapy, or both. For patients who have not responded to these treatments, electroconvulsive therapy may be given. Depression is usually treated successfully. If a cause is identified, it is corrected first before giving drugs if needed.

# Conclusion

Major Depressive Disorder is a serious medical illness that is very common among the world’s population. Unlike sadness and grief, which is normal and temporary, depression is chronic and its symptoms are much more severe. Depression can affect one’s physical health, and even interfere with lifestyle. Luckily, depression is very much treatable; with proper communication and / or the right resources, depression can be treated as easily as other illnesses.
